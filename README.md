# Name of the project:
Parallax Website

# About the project: 
This is a super cool website made using HTML and CSS. It makes you feel the amazing parallax effect on your device using 4 images. Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. The everyday example of this is seen driving on the highway-- when you look out the window, electrical poles near the road seem to zoom past, while trees in the distance appear to slowly drift by.

# Tech stack used:
HTML, CSS

# Motivation for the project:
I got motivated seeing the hardwork our seniors are doing for us and the dedication level of my friends and decided to make this cool website.

# How the 7 days of Web Development helped me:
I learnt html in class 10 th but due to discontinous of practice, i had forgotten it partially. These 7 days not only helped me to remind me about html but also i learnt 2 new things i.e. css and javascript.
